    question: "How the registration process works?",
    answer:
      "Unlike all other hackathons, our registration process will be slightly different. But the entire process is very simple, just go to top and hit that Apply With Devfolio button. That's it. Then you will be prompted to make a quick submission of the questionnaires within the Devfolio platform.",
    /*  - What is the pain or problem that you're trying to solve?
    - Who's affected by the pain or problem? ( It's good to get some real data from the affected people. )
    - Does this problem have a tendency to grow and why?
    - How you're going to approach the problem?
    - Do you have a team? If yes, then who are the team members?
    - Do you have any plans to continue building the project even after the hackathon? If yes, then what's your vision for future?

    question: "What happen during the Sprint Day?",
    answer:
      "SprintDay is the first day of the hackathon where teams will collaborate with UI / UX Designers and will begin working on their ideas on site.

Most of the of SprintDay is about understanding the problem and developing prototypes, so please remember to bring your laptops and any other equipment and materials you might need to work.
